### Database Prep

- Access the MySQL interface in your terminal by running `mysql -u root -p`
- Create a new database called facebook: `create database facebook`
- Add a `.env` file to the project folder of this repository containing the MySQL authentication information for MySQL user. For example:

```bash
  DB_HOST=localhost
  DB_USER=root
  DB_NAME=facebook
  DB_PASS=YOURPASSWORD
```

- Run `npm run migrate` in the project folder of this repository, in a new terminal window. This will create a table called 'students' in your database.

- Make sure you understand how the `students` table is constructed. In your MySQL console, you can run `use facebook;` and then `describe students;` to see the structure of the students table.

### Development

- Run `npm start` in project directory to start the Express server on port 4000
- In another terminal, do `cd client` and run `npm run dev` to start the client in development mode with hot reloading in port 5173.

## Basic Requirements

Create a webpage with the following functionality:

- [ ] A list of students.
- [ ] A form to add new students. There should be fields to input the first and last names, separately.
  - After submitting the form, the new student should be added to the database and displayed on the page.
- [ ] Each student can be deleted with a delete button. After clicking on this button, student should be deleted from the database and the updated list of students shown on the page
- [ ] Style the app to make it look as polished as possible. Bootstrap is already loaded in the index.html file, so you can use it if you want to.
- [ ] (Optional/bonus) Clicking on a student should show the student's profile to the right of the students list. The info to display this profile should be obtained from a fetch request to `/students/:id`
